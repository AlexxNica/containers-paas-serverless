# How to Use Flightassist

First, you want to [add a trip from Triplt](https://www.tripit.com/trip/create). Then, add a new flight plan for your trip. In your plan, please fill in your confirmation number or airline with flight number.

Once you added a new plan and you have your Flightassist running, open your Flightassist and click **Authenticate with TripIt** to login to Flightassist.

Now you can see the most recent flight status and weather for all your flights within 24 hours.
